# Project Name: YouTube Data Science Insights

## 1. Overview
YouTube Data Science Insights is a data-driven project aimed at exploring key factors that influence the success of YouTube videos in the data science niche. The project involves leveraging the YouTube API to obtain video data, conducting in-depth analyses, and dispelling common myths surrounding video performance. By utilizing various data analysis techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we aim to provide valuable insights to content creators, data science students, and enthusiasts.

## 2. Project Objectives
- Understanding the YouTube API: Familiarize ourselves with the YouTube API to collect relevant video data required for analysis.
- Validating Common "Myths" About Video Success: Investigate the impact of likes, comments, video duration, and title length on video views to validate or debunk common beliefs surrounding YouTube video performance.
- Analyzing Tags and Trending Topics: Explore the relationship between the number of tags used in successful videos and identify common tags among high-performing content. Additionally, utilize NLP techniques to uncover trending topics and themes based on video titles.
- Understanding Creator Upload Patterns: Analyze the upload frequency of data science creators, examining the best days for publishing new videos to maximize audience engagement.
- Uncovering Viewer Interests: Investigate the types of questions asked in video comment sections to gain insights into viewer engagement and interests.
- Interactive Report Generation: As an outcome of our analyses, I will create detailed and interactive reports. These reports will serve as valuable resources for data science enthusiasts, educators, and aspiring content creators, fostering a thriving YouTube data science community.

## 3. Workflow and Methodology
- **Obtaining Video Metadata via YouTube API**: The first step involves utilizing the YouTube API to gather video metadata from the top 10-15 data science channels. To achieve this, you will need to create a developer key, request data from the API, and transform the responses into a usable data format. This process will provide the foundation for subsequent analyses.
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Once the video metadata is collected, the next step is to preprocess the data to ensure consistency and handle any missing or erroneous information. Additionally, feature engineering will be performed to extract relevant insights from the video data, setting the stage for deeper analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: With the preprocessed data and engineered features, exploratory data analysis will be conducted. This step involves visualizing and summarizing key statistics, trends, and patterns within the data. Through EDA, we aim to gain initial insights into factors that contribute to video success and identify potential relationships between variables.
- **Drawing Conclusions**: The final step of the project entails drawing meaningful conclusions based on the findings from the exploratory data analysis. By examining the relationships between various video metrics and performance, we will address the project objectives, validate or debunk video "myths," and provide actionable insights for content creators in the data science niche.



## 4. Installation
